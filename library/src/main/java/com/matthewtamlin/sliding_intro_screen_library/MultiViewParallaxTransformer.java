 * Views displayed in the pages. Parallax effects are assigned by mapping parallax factors to
 * resource IDs. A parallax factor is a scale factor, which determines how Views are positioned
 * compared to the drag position.
 * <p/>
 * For example, if a parallax factor of 1.2 is provided for the resource ID {@code R.id.myview},
 * then all Views with that resource ID will have a 20% parallax effect. This means that when the
 * page is scrolled in some direction by some number of pixels (call this variable x), then the
 * affected views will be scrolled 1.2*x pixels in the same direction.
 * <p/>
 * This class can safely be used with ViewPager instances where not all pages have the same
 * views/layout.
